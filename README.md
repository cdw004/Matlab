# The Power of Plots

The fictional organization Pyberhas viewed the sucess of Uber and lyft and wants to enter the ride sharing industry. 

Utilizing historic data, I created a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four variables: 

Average Fare ($) Per City
Total Number of Rides Per City
Total Number of Drivers Per City
City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

This project utilized Pandas Library, Jupyter notebook, MatPlotLib, as well as seaborn libraries.
